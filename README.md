# This is How You Format A Title

**This will format bold**

For example:

**TODO 1 :** Here, create two variables in the same statement, one named `prompt` which will hold the prompt module, and one named `fs` to hold the file-system module:

This is how you format code:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// TODO 1 : create variables for prompt and fs by calling require in each respective module:
var 
    prompt = require("prompt"),
    fs = require("fs")
    ;
```


**Run the App** Switch to the command line, and go ahead and run the app like so:
And this is how you put a box around your text:

    # ./magic-eight-ball.js
